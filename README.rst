djangostrap
===========

djangostrap is a BASH script that creates a Django project inside virtualenv
with Git scm.

While the script is fairly flexible, it follows the routine that I use day to
day, so it might not fit every use case scenario.

Basic usage
===========

For complete instructions on usage, simply execute the script with no 
arguments.

Typically, djangostrap is used like this::

    ./djangostrap.sh -c /path/to/settings_template.py project.git project_name

``project.git`` is the directory where the virtualenv will live. It is also the
root directory of the git project. ``project_name`` is the name of the Django
project package.

By supplying the ``-c`` switch, we can use a settings module template instead
of the default settings module generated by ``django-admin``.

Settings template
=================

Settings template supplied with djangostraps assumes that you want to control
the production and development settings using environment variables. While this
is quite convenient in some cases (e.g., Supervisor supports setting
environment variables in its configuration files), it may be cumbersome in
other situations (e.g., you want to run syncdb but then you have to set all the
environment variables related to databases).

I recommend you go through the ``settings_template.py`` file and see if it fits
your needs. Note that inside settings template, the ``@@@`` represents a
placeholder that will be replaced with the value of ``project_name`` (see 
`Basic usage`_).
